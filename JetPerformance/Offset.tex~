The effect of pile-up in 2010 data can be assessed looking at the inclusive jet cross-section.
Each period has a different pile-up conditions, but the data can be loosely split into period A-C which has low levels of pile-up, D-F medium levels of pile-up and G-I which has higher levels of pile-up, plus bunch trains.


To reduce the effect of pile-up, and offset correction has been determined, which removes an average amount of energy from jets, depending on the number of primary vertices in the event.
Figures \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Nominal_Central} and \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Nominal_Forward} shows the effect of this offset correction on the inclusive jet cross-section measurement as a function of jet \pt{} for central and forward jets respectively.
In all regions period A-C have very little change, which is expected due to the low pile-up condition.
Period D-F and G-I have larger deviations due to the correction, which is agrees with expectation due to increasing pile-up conditions.
%Period C will be used as a test no pile-up sample to check the distributions with no pile-up.


Figures \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Central} and \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Forward} show the inclusive jet cross-section for the medium and high pile-up conditions divided by the inclusive cross-section for the low pile-up periods. 
Differences should arise from the differing levels of pile-up (luminosity weights can also effect this).  
The main differences occurs at the lowest jet \pt{} bin, which would be expected due to the steeply falling \pt{} distribution.
The effect from the highest pile-up periods is approximately 15\% in the lowest \pt{} bin for the plots in Figure \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Central}, except for the \etaRange{0.8}{1.2} plot which is approximately 30\%.
In the forward plots in Figure \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Forward} the effect of the increase due to pile-up is reduced.
Pile-up jets falling into the forward region are a lot higher energy, and so there are fewer pile-up jets of a given \pt{}, leading to the lower effect seen in Figure \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Forward}.


The effects of the offset correction are shown in Figures \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Correction_Central} and \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Correction_Forward} which show the inclusive jet cross-section for the medium and high pile-up conditions divided by the inclusive jet cross-section for the low pile-up periods for offset corrected jets. 
The first four bins have been fitted with,
\begin{equation}
y =1 + \frac{a}{x},
\label{JetPerf:BinFit}
\end{equation}
to help reduce the statistical fluctuations.
The effect of the pile-up offset correction is to reduce the observed pile-up effect leading to differences of $<10\%$ in most of the central bins, again with the exception of the \etaRange{0.8}{1.2} plot, which has seen a reduction to approximately 20\% for the high pile-up sample. 
In the two most forward bins, where the effect previously was small, there seems to have been an over correction giving a deviation for the highest pile-up sample of approximately 10\%.
