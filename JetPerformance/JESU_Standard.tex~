\subsubsection{Standard Method for Dijet Balance}

In the standard method, one of the jets is required to be in a reference region where the jet is well calibrated and understood.
This jet is defined as the ``reference'' jet.
The other jet is the ``probe'' jet, and is used to probe the regions outside the reference region.


Given these definitions, Equations \ref{JetPerf:Assym} and \ref{JetPerf:JetResp} become,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} =\frac{\pt{}^{probe} - \pt{}^{ref}}{\pt{}^{ave}}
\rm{ and } 
\frac{\pt{}^{ref}}{\pt{}^{probe}}=\frac{2+\mathcal{A}}{2-\mathcal{A}}=\frac{1}{\rm c},
\label{JetPerf:SM_Eqn}
\end{equation}
where $|\rm c|$ is the inter-calibration factor of the probe jet.  

Using this standard method, a asymmetry distribution, $\mathcal{A}_{ik}$ , is attained in bins of $\eta$ and $\phi$.
The inter-calibration factor for the i-th $\eta$ and k-th $\pt{}^{ave}$ bin is defined as
\begin{equation}
\rm{c_{ik}} =\frac{2-\mean{\mathcal{A}_{ik}}}{2+\mean{\mathcal{A}_{ik}}},
\label{JetPerf:SM_CorrectionFactor}
\end{equation}
where \mean{\mathcal{A}_{ik}} is the mean value of the asymmetry distribution in the bin.
