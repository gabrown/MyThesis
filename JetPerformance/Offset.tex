The effect of pile-up in 2010 data can be assessed looking at the inclusive jet cross-section.
Each period has a different pileup conditions, but the data can be loosely split into period A-C which has low levels of pileup, D-F medium levels of pileup and G-I which has higher levels of pileup, plus bunch trains.


To reduce the effect of pileup, and offset correction has been determined, which removes an average amount of energy from jets, depending on the number of primary vertices in the event.
Figures \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Nominal_Central} and \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Nominal_Forward} shows the effect of this offset correction on the inclusive jet cross-section measurement as a function of jet \pt{} for central and forward jets respectively.
In all regions period A-C have very little change, which is expected due to the low pileup condition.
Period D-F and G-I have larger deviations due to the correction, which is agrees with expectation due to increasing pileup conditions.
%Period C will be used as a test no pileup sample to check the distributions with no pileup.


Figures \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Central} and \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Forward} show the inclusive jet cross-section for the medium and high pileup conditions divided by the inclusive cross-section for the low pileup periods. 
Differences should arise from the differing levels of pileup (luminosity weights can also effect this).  
The main differences occurs at the lowest jet \pt{} bin, which would be expected due to the steeply falling \pt{} distribution.
The effect from the highest pileup periods is approximately 15\% in the lowest \pt{} bin for the plots in Figure \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Central}, except for the \etaRange{0.8}{1.2} plot which is approximately 30\%.
In the forward plots in Figure \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Forward} the effect of the increase due to pileup is reduced.
Pileup jets falling into the forward region are a lot higher energy, and so there are fewer pileup jets of a given \pt{}, leading to the lower effect seen in Figure \ref{JetPerf:EtaJES_Correction_Forward}.


The effects of the offset correction are shown in Figures \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Correction_Central} and \ref{JetPerf:Offset_Correction_Forward} which show the inclusive jet cross-section for the medium and high pileup conditions divided by the inclusive jet cross-section for the low pileup periods for offset corrected jets. 
The first four bins have been fitted with,
\begin{equation}
y =1 + \frac{a}{x},
\label{JetPerf:BinFit}
\end{equation}
to help reduce the statistical fluctuations.
The effect of the pileup offset correction is to reduce the observed pileup effect leading to differences of $<10\%$ in most of the central bins, again with the exception of the \etaRange{0.8}{1.2} plot, which has seen a reduction to approximately 20\% for the high pileup sample. 
In the two most forward bins, where the effect previously was small, there seems to have been an over correction giving a deviation for the highest pileup sample of approximately 10\%.
