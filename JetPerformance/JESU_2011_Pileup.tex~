\subsubsection{Effect of Pileup on Dijet Balance}

The effect of the number of pileup vertices, NPV, and the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing, $\mu$, on the relative response from the matrix method are presented in this section.
Figure \ref{JetPerf:NPV_Mu} shows (a) the NPV distribution and (b) the $\mu$ distributions.
Three NPV regions are defined to select different pileup conditions, \Range{NPV}{0}{2}, \Range{NPV}{3}{6}, and  $\rm NPV\ge7$, with an average NPV of 2.48, 4.48 and 7.71 respectively. 
Two NPV regions are defined, \Range{\mu}{0}{7} and  $\mu > 7$, with an average $\mu$ of 5.33 and 9.94 respectively. 
Data points which have no cuts on $\mu$ or NPV are also shown, which have an average NPV and $\mu$ of 5.19 and 6.48.


%High NPV:  Ave NVP:  7.71314
%Med NPV:  Ave NVP:  4.48111
%Low NPV:  Ave NVP:  2.47613
%Standard: Average mu : 6.47532  Ave NVP:  5.18579


Figure \ref{JetPerf:PileupComp_j10} shows the relative response as a function of detector $\eta$ for jets with $22<\ptave{}<30$ GeV.
At low pileup there is generally a lower response outside of the reference region, whereas at higher pileup the response is close to unity. 
Figure \ref{JetPerf:PileupComp_j15} shows the relative response for jets with $30<\ptave{}<40$ GeV.
Again, in low pileup conditions the relative response is lower. 
However, in higher pileup conditions the relative response is higher in the forward regions.
Figure \ref{JetPerf:PileupComp_j20} shows the relative response for jets with $40<\ptave{}<55$ GeV.
The different pileup conditions result in very similar  relative responses, indicating that pileup has less effect at higher jet \pt{}.
The explaination is that pileup can be considered to contribute and average ammount of energy thoughout the detector.
For low \pt{} jets, this can significantly increase their \pt{}. 
However for higher \pt{} jets, this increase in energy is small compared to the total \pt{} of the jet. 

Figures \ref{JetPerf:MuComp_j10} - \ref{JetPerf:MuComp_j20} show the relative response as a function of detector $\eta$ for low, medium and high $\mu$ and the whole dataset. 
Within the statistical error bars, all the results show a less than 3 percent spread, even in the lowest \ptave{} bin.
***********Note here that the Low Mu has low stats, so I will ignore it in the explanation and remake the plots with just 2 curves on.  ******

The observed effects from NPV and $\mu$ are relatively small, and are covered by the uncertainty in the jet pileup correction, and therefore do not need to be added to the JES uncertainty from the dijet balance.
