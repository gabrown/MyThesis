\label{sec:Det:Over}

A schematic of the ATLAS detector is shown in Figure \ref{Det:ATLAS}. 
In this section the different detectors which make up the ATLAS detector will be reviewed. 
First the magnet system, which provides the magnetic field for the tracking detectors, will be discribed. 
Next the inner detector, the closest detector to the beam line, will be discribed, followed by the calorimeter systems and the muon detectors.
The calorimeters have been described in higher detail due to their relevence to this thesis.
