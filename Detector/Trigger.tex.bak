\subsection{Trigger and Data Acquisition}

The event rate from the LHC is 1GHz *Check This*, but only $\mathcal{O}(200Hz)$ will be recorded to disk. The ATLAS trigger and data acquisition system (TDAQ) reduces this rate by trying to select to most interesting events.
TDAQ is split into subsystems that are approximately associated with the sub-detects previously described. The three different trigger levels are level 1 (L1), level 2 (L2), and event filter (EF). The trigger levels are applied in series, with each level refining the desion and adding additional requirements. 
L1 is required to make a decision in less than $2.5\mu$s and requduce the rate to 75 kHz. If the event has passed a L1 trigger, it then goes through the L2 and EF trigger which have more information about the event and reduces the rate to 200Hz.
While the trigger is deciding if the even should be kept, the data acquisition system is buffering the event information.



L1 triggers try and select interesting objects, like high $pT$ jets, electons, muons, photons, taus or large missing $E_T$, which are idicitive of interesting physics processes.
