The basic properties of the LHC are summarised in section \ref{sec:Det:LHC}. 
Sections \ref{sec:Det:Coord} and \ref{sec:Det:Over} define the ATLAS coordinate system and give a brief overview of the detector, working outwards from the beam line.
Those components of the detector of particular relevance to this analysis are described in more detail in Section \ref{sec:Det:Cal} and \ref{sec:Det:Trig}.
