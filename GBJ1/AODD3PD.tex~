\subsection{Stability of Event Selection}
\label{sec:GBJ1:AODD3PD}

An independent analysis was done by a different member of the analysis team running over ATLAS D3PDs, which are a flat ntuple format. 
Table \ref{GBJ1:CutFlow} shows the number of events after each cut for both the AOD and D3PD formats, and also the fractional difference between the two, for the different data periods. 
The differences in the table are of the order 1:1000 which indicates that the cut flow is stable.  
These small differences are attributed to the data compression algorithms that store the data information.
This effect is small compared to the other systematics in the analysis.
