\subsection{Jet Cleaning}
\label{sec:GBJ1:Cleaning}

The effect of jet cleaning is investigated by examining the change in the gap fraction and the inclusive distribution when using a tighter definition. 
Figure \ref{JetCleanIncl_dy} shows two slices in $\bar{p_T}$ of the inclusive distribution in $\Delta y$ for the leading \pt{} dijet selection with both the loose and medium cuts applied. 
There is $\thicksim\, 2\: \%\: $ reduction in statistics using the medium cuts, but the shape of the distribution seems to be unchanged.  
For the leading \pt{} dijet selection, the gap fraction is shown as a function of $\bar{p_T}$ in Figure \ref{JetCleanGF_dy} and as a function of $\Delta y$ in Figure \ref{JetCleanGF_pt} with the two different jet cleaning definitions. 
The difference in the gap fraction between the two cleaning definitions is small ($<1\%$) and within the statistical uncertainty of the samples, and as more statistics are gained with the loose bad jet definition.
Similar order effects are observed with the forward/backward selection.
Given that there is little bias and the improvement in statistics, this is used for the remaining analysis. 
Normally one would have to worr about normalisation problems in the inclusive distributions, however this analysis only details fractions where the normalisation cancels.
