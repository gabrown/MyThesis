\subsection{Jet Cleaning}
\label{sec:GBJ1:Cleaning}

The effect of jet cleaning is investigated by examining the change in the gap fraction and the inclusive distribution when using a tighter cleaning definition. 
The two cleaning selections used are loose and medium, which are defined in Section~\ref{sec:Det:Jets}.
The medium cleaning selection removes more bad jets than the loose cleaning selection, however it has inefficiencies for good jets at low \pt{}.
The loose cleaning selection has $>99\%$ efficiency for good jets.

Figure \ref{JetCleanIncl_dy} shows two slices in \ptb{} of the inclusive distribution in \dy{} for the leading \pt{} dijet selection with both the loose and medium cleaning selections applied. 
There is $\approx 2\: \%\: $ reduction in statistics using the medium cleaning selection, but the shape of the distribution seems to be unchanged.  
For the leading \pt{} dijet selection, the gap fraction is shown as a function of \ptb{} in Figure \ref{JetCleanGF_dy} and as a function of \dy{} in Figure \ref{JetCleanGF_pt} with the two different jet cleaning definitions. 
The difference in the gap fraction between the two cleaning definitions is small ($<1\%$) and within the statistical uncertainty of the samples, and more statistics are gained with the loose bad jet definition.
Similar order effects are observed with the forward/backward selection.
Given that there is little bias and the improvement in statistics, this is used for the remaining analysis.
