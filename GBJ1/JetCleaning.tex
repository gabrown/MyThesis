\subsection{Jet Cleaning}
\label{sec:GBJ1:Cleaning}

The effect of jet cleaning is investigated by examining the change in the gap fraction and the inclusive distribution when using a tighter definition. 
Figure \ref{JetCleanIncl_dy} shows two slices in $\bar{p_T}$ of the inclusive distribution in $\Delta y$ with both the loose and medium cuts applied. 
There is $\thicksim\, 2\: \%\: $reduction in statistics using the medium cuts, but the shape of the distribution seems to be unchanged.  
The gap fraction is shown as a function of $\bar{p_T}$ in figure \ref{JetCleanGF_dy} and as a function of $\Delta y$ in figure \ref{JetCleanGF_pt} with the two different jet cleaning definitions. 
The difference in the gap fraction between the two cleaning definitions is small ($<1\%$) and within the statistical uncertainty of the samples, and as more statistics are gained with the loose bad jet definition, this is used for the remaining analysis.
