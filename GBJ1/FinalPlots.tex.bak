\section{Final Plots}
\label{sec:GBJ1:FinalPlots}
In this section, the final plots that were shown in the publication are discussed. The plots shown are from both selections and show the gap fraction as a function of $\Delta y$, $\bar{p_T}$ and $Q_0$, and also the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval as a function of $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$. When $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ is looked at, $Q_0$ is always at a fixed value of 20 GeV. The data is sliced up into different regions, and so the gap fraction vurses $\Delta y$ distribution is shown, if is done 7 different $\bar{p_T}$ ranges, and similar is done the other way. Each slice is offset to allow the data to be shown on one plot, and next to each plot the ratio of the theory predictions to data is shown.

On each plot, the black points are the data points with statistical uncertainty bars, with the yellow bands being the systematic uncertainty (from the JES and unfolding). The red and blue dotted line is the POWHEG + PYTHIA and POWHEG + HERWIG predictions respectively, and the blue band is the HEJ prediction with a theoretical uncertainty.

Figures \ref{GBJ1:dYSelA} and \ref{GBJ1:pTSelA} are the gap fraction as a function of $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ respectively. The figure illistrates that HEJ  agrees well with the data for the complete range in $\Delta y$ for low $\bar{p_T}$, but at higher $\bar{p_T}$ slices it seems to deviate away from the data giving too many gap events. As explained in section XXX, HEJ works by resumming terms of $\Delta y$ when $\bar{p_T}/Q_0$ is small, so not too surprising that a deviation if observed at larger $\bar{p_T}/Q_0$ ($Q_0$ is fixed). 
POWHEG + PYTHIA probably gives the best overall discription of the data, but at large $\Delta y$ the gap fraction is too low. *explain why this might be for POWHEG in general*  POWHEG + HERWIG seems to give too much activity in all phase space regions, and this deviation gets larger for larger $\Delta y$. 


%Figures \ref{GBJ1:dYSelA} and \ref{GBJ1:pTSelA} are the gap fraction as a function of $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ respectively. Figure \ref{GBJ1:dYSelA} illistrates that for low $\bar{p_T}$ that HEJ agrees well with the data for the complete range in $\Delta y$, but at higher $\bar{p_T}$ slices it seems to deviate away from the data. The figure also shows how both POWHEG curves agree at low $\Delta y$, but deviates at higher $\Delta y$. Figure \ref{GBJ1:pTSelA} makes this point even more apparent where POWHEG + PYTHIA agrees well with the data accross the $\bar{p_T}$ range for low $\Delta y$ slices, but then deviates in the larger $\Delta y$ slices.


Figure \ref{GBJ1:Q0SelA} is the gap fraction as a function of $Q_0$ for various $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ slices. The figure shows that none of the theoretical curves agree well with the data when the large $\Delta y$ or $\bar{p_T}$ slices are considered. Both HEJ and POWHEG + PYTHIA do well in the low $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ slice. When larger $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ slices are looked at they both deviate from the data, with HEJ improving its agreement at larger values of $Q_0$. As seen in the previous figures, POWHEG + HERWIG still gives a gap fraction lower than the POWHEG + PYTHIA, and that is far from the data for all ranges. 


%Figure \ref{GBJ1:Q0SelA} is the gap fraction as a function of $Q_0$ for various $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ slices. The figure shows that the POWHEG + PYTHIA agrees with the data quite well for the low $\Delta y$ slices (even with a larger $\bar{p_T}$ slice), but seems to undershots the data for the larger $\Delta y$ slices, indicating that there is not enough activity in the gap region for large $\Delta y$ events. HEJ doesn quite well in the low $\Delta y$ and low $\bar{p_T}$ slice, but overshots at low $Q_0$ at either larger $\Delta y$ or $\bar{p_T}$ slices, indicating that events are two likely to have a jet with $p_T>20$ GeV in all events bar the low  $\Delta y$ or $\bar{p_T}$ region.


Figures \ref{GBJ1:NjetsdYSelA} and \ref{GBJ1:NjetspTSelA} are the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval between the boundary jets as a function of $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ respectively. This is an alternative method at probing the activity between the boundary jets. Where the gap fraction is only conserned with the leading jet in the rapidity region, the average number of jets consideres all jet in that region with a $p_T>20$ GeV. In both plots it can be seen that, except at very low $\bar{p_T}$, HEJ underestimates the the number of jets in the gap region, which is in agreement with what is seen in the gap fraction plots. POWHEG + PYTHIA does quite well in all regions of agreeing with the data and is still the best discripter of the data, whereas POWHEG + HERWIG seems to slightly overestimate the data thorught the curves, and gets worse at lower $\bar{p_T}$.
