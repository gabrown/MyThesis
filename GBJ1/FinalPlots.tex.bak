\section{Corrected Data}
\label{sec:GBJ1:FinalPlots}

In this section, the final plots that were shown in the publication are discussed. 
The plots shown are from  the leading $p_T$ dijet selection and the forward/backwards selection and show the gap fraction as a function of $\Delta y$, $\bar{p_T}$ and $Q_0$, and also the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval as a function of $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$. 
When $\Delta y$ and $\bar{p_T}$ is studied, $Q_0$ is always at a fixed value of 20 GeV. 
The data is sliced up into different regions, and so the gap fraction versus $\Delta y$ distribution is shown for seven different $\bar{p_T}$ ranges, and similarly for the $\bar{p_T}$ distribution. 
Each slice is offset to allow the data to be shown on one plot. 
The ratio of the theory predictions to data is shown next to each plot.

On each plot, the black points are the data points with statistical uncertainty bars, with the yellow bands indicating the systematic uncertainty from both the JES and unfolding. 
The red and blue dotted lines are the POWHEG + PYTHIA and POWHEG + HERWIG predictions respectively, and the blue band is the HEJ prediction with a theoretical uncertainty.

Figures \ref{GBJ1:dYSelA} and \ref{GBJ1:pTSelA} show the gap fraction and the ratio of theory to data as a function of $\dy{}$ and $\ptb{}$ respectively for different \ptb{} and \dy{} slices for the leading \pt{} dijet selection. 
The gap fraction from the data reduces as a function of \ptb{} and \dy{}.
When the rapidity region between the dijets is small the phase-space for emission is small. 
When the \dy{} or the \ptb{} of the dijets increases that phase-space availible for emmission increase, and so the gap fraction decreases.
The gap fraction for data levels off at higher \ptb{}.
As described in Section \ref{sec:Theory:Dijet}, the extra terms that become important in calculating the gap cross section go as the $\ln\frac{Q}{\qz{}}$, where Q is the \pt{} scale of the hard interaction which is like \ptb{}.
This leveling off can be explained by the difference in the $\ln$  at different \ptb{}. 
This difference is larger between a \ptb{} of 50 GeV and 200 GeV than 200 GeV to 500 GeV.

HEJ agrees well with the data for the complete range in $\dy$ for low $\ptb{}$. 
However, for $\ptb{}$ slices $150\ge\ptb{}>180$ GeV and above, HEJ starts to overestimate the gap fraction.
This deviation is shown more clearly when plotting as a function of \ptb{}.
For all but the highest \dy{} slices, where there are significan uncertainties, HEJ deviates from the data for $\ptb{}>140$ GeV.
As described in Section \ref{Theory:MC}, HEJ generates partons with similar \pt{}.
Therefore, is it not unexpected that it should do better when \qz{} and \ptb{} are similar, and to do worse when the diffence gets large.

POWHEG + PYTHIA and POWHEG + HERWIG give significantly different gap fractions as a function of \dy{} and \ptb{}.
POWHEG + PYTHIA gives the best overall description of the data.
POWHEG + PYTHIA agrees with the data at all \ptb{} slices for low \dy{}, however it starts to deviate for $\dy{}>3.5$. 
This can also be seen for the gap fraction as a function of \ptb{} for the different \dy{} slices. 
For the slices, $1\ge\dy{}>2$, $2\ge\dy{}>3$, and $3\ge\dy{}>4$, the agreement is very good throughout \ptb{}, with only deviations away from the data at large \dy{} which correspond to statistical fluctuations.
However, for the other \dy{} slices POWHEG + PYTHIA gives too low a gap fraction.
The NLO calculation of POWHEG plus the parton showering from PYTHIA does not have terms that become important for large \dy{}.
Conversely, POWHEG + HERWIG only agrees with the data only in the lowest of \dy{} bins, it deviates for $\dy{}>1$ for all slices of \ptb{}. 
In the gap fraction against \ptb{} for different \dy{} slices distributions, POWHEG + HERWIG does not agree well with the data and underestimates the gap fraction for all considered regions of phase-space.
The difference between POWHEG + PYTHIA and POWHEG + HERWIG would indicate the parton showering has a significant effect on the gap fraction. 


Figure \ref{GBJ1:Q0SelA} shows the gap fraction as a function of \qz{} for different slices in \dy{} and \ptb{} for the leading \pt{} dijet selection.
For a low \qz{} value, the gap fraction is at a minimum, as any increase in \qz{} will reduce the number of events with a jet above \qz{}.
When the \qz{} increases the gap fraction increases, which is expected as the probablitiy of getting a very high \pt{} emmision is low.

POWHEG + HERWIG underestimates the data in all slices considered and for all but the highest \qz{} bins, indicating that there is too much emission from the POWHEG + the HERWIG parton shower. 
For the gap fraction against \qz{} for $2\ge\dy{}<3$ and  $70\ge\pt{}<90$ GeV slice, both HEJ and POWHEG + PYTHIA over laps with the data throught the \qz{} range. 
For the other slices, as low \qz{} HEJ overestimates the gap fraction, but improves as \qz{} and \ptb{} become closer, which is expected as HEJ generates partons with similar \pt{}.
Neither POWHEG + PYTHIA or HEJ agrees well with the gap fraction when both \dy{} and \qz{} is large.



Figures \ref{GBJ1:NjetsdYSelA} and \ref{GBJ1:NjetspTSelA} are the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval between the boundary jets as a function of $\dy{}$ and $\ptb{}$ respectively for slices in \ptb{} and \dy{} for the leading \pt{} dijet selection. 
This is an alternative method of probing the activity between the boundary jets. 
The gap fraction is only concerned with the leading jet in the rapidity region, but the average number of jets considers all jet in that region with a $\pt{}>20$ GeV. 
As with the gap fraction, POWHEG + PYTHIA agrees best with the data.
POWHEG + HERWIG consitantly gives too much activity in the rapidity region, which helps to explain why the POWHEG + HERWIG gap fraction is below the data.
Except at very low \ptb{}, HEJ has too little activity in the rapidity region.
Comparing to the gap fraction slices, in which it agrees with data, would indicate that HEJ describes only the highest \pt{} emission between the dijet well. 
the agreement may improve if HEJ was interfaced to a \pt{} ordered parton shower.

 
Figures \ref{GBJ1:dYSelB} and \ref{GBJ1:pTSelB} show the gap fraction and the ratio of theory to data as a function of $\dy{}$ and $\ptb{}$ respectively for different \ptb{} and \dy{} slices for the forward/backward dijet selection.
For this selection, there are often imbalences in the \pt{} of the boundary jets, especially at larger \ptb{}.
All three theory comparisons show similar difference to the data. 
The gap fraction from HEJ as a function of \dy{} falls below the data for low \ptb{} slices. 
This has been suggested in cite{ref:Anderson1} that this is due to the importance of soft emission from the dijets.

Figure \ref{GBJ1:Q0SelA} shows the gap fraction as a function of \qz{} for different slices in \dy{} and \ptb{} for the forward/backward dijet selection.
For the leading \pt{} dijet selection the \qz{} could only be measured upto the \ptb{}, but with this selection the gap fraction can be less than one, as there can be jets with higher \pt{} than the \ptb{}.
The gap fraction does not rise as quickly as in the previous selection.
The POWHEG + PYTHIA  shows similar agreement to the data as for the previous selection.
HEJ does not agree well with the data, and especially for the higher \dy{} slices have consistantly low gap fraction throughout \qz{}. 

Figure \ref{GBJ1:pTSelBQ0} shows the gap fraction as a function of $\dy{}$ and $\ptb{}$ respectively for different \ptb{} and \dy{} slices for the forward/backward dijet selection, but the \qz{} is set to the \ptb{} of the event. 
This shows how the gap fraction is effected by emissions which are harder than the \ptb{} dijets. 
POWHEG + PYTHIA and POWHEG + HERWIG both overlap the data.
This would indicate that this definition of the gap fraction is less dependant on the modeling of the parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event.
The new definition of the jet veto does not improve the HEJ agreement with the data.


Since publishing the results of this analysis, several papers \cite{ref:Anderson1,ref:JeffNew} have compared  their theoretical predictions to the ATLAS data. 
Both disussed the unreliablity of fixed order calculations in this topology of event.
\cite{ref:JeffNew} used an all-order resummation in $\log\frac{\bar{p_T}}{Q_0}$ terms to compare to the data. 
The conclusion of the paper was: ``The message is clear: the accuracy of the ATLAS data already demands better theoretical calculations".
