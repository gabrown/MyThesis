The emission of energy into the gap between a dijet system is studied for the first time at a hadron collider in this analysis. $\Delta y - \frac{\bar{p_T}}{p_T^{veto}}$ phase space (as seen in the theory chapter) has been probed is by slicing it up into different regions (in $\Delta y$ and ${\bar{p_T}}$) and by looking how the gap fraction changes as a function of either $\Delta y$, ${\bar{p_T}}$ or ${p_T^{veto}}$.
Gap fraction as a function of $\Delta y$ studied by having multiple slices in ${\bar{p_T}}$, as well as having a fixed ${p_T^{veto}}$ value. The same was done for ${\bar{p_T}}$ but now slicing in $\Delta y$. The gap fraction as a function of ${p_T^{veto}}$ distributions are sliced in both $\Delta y$ and ${\bar{p_T}}$.

The two different boundary jet definitions that are used are :

\begin{enumerate}
   \item  Two highest $p_T$ jets in the events;
   \item  The most forward and most backwards jets in the events (above a given $p_T$).
\end{enumerate}

This chapter will first look at analysis and event selection in section x and y. Then in sections z-b  the stability of the data under the event selection with a thourough look at both the jet cleaning cuts and the pileup cut. There will

Sources of systematic uncertainty arising from the event selection, especially from the jet cleaning, and the pile-up cuts.
 
Then, a look into how the data agrees with reconstructed PYTHIA to check that the agreement is good enough to use PYTHIA for unfolding the detector effects

Finally, the final results are shown, with explanations of the work done by other members of the analysis team to get these results.
