The study into dijet production with a jet veto is presented.
These observables are compared for a dijet rapidity separation of up to 6 units in rapidity, and $50\le\ptb{}<500$.
The data are compared to POWHEG with both the PYTHIA parton shower (POWHEG + PYTHIA) and the HERWIG parton shower (POWHEG + HERWIG), and also to the HEJ generator. 
The data are also compared to PYTHIA, HERWIG++ and ALPGEN.
A description of these genertors can be found in Section \ref{Theory:MC}.

The topology and event selection are outlined in Section \ref{sec:GBJ1:AnalSel} and \ref{sec:GBJ1:EvtSel}, respectively. 
In Section \ref{sec:GBJ1:DataStab}, the robustness of the event selection will be examined. 
In Section \ref{sec:GBJ1:Uncorr}, the selected data will be compared to the simulated PYTHIA sample.
Section \ref{sec:GBJ1:OtherWork} outlines the work done by other members of the analysis team that was required to get the final measurements, which are presented in Section \ref{sec:GBJ1:FinalPlots} and published in \cite{ATLASGap}.
