\subsubsection{Jet Cleaning}
Jet cleaning is done to make sure the sample contains only well measured jets that come from real energy deposits. Jet cleaning removes two category's of jets, "ugly" and "bad" jets.

Ugly jets are jets that are badly measured but do come from real energy deposits. Ugly jets are often found in regions between detectors,"crack", where te performance of the detectors aren't optimal (see section on detects). The two cuts that are applied to remove ugly jets are, 
$frac_{TileGap3}>0.5$ where $frac_{TileGap3}$ is the ...., and $frac_{BadCell}>0.5$ where $frac_{BadCell}$ is the fraction of the electro magnetic energy of the jet that comes from bad cells inside the jet.

Bad jets are jets that don't come from a real energy deposit. Bad jets can come from a variety of different sources, three that are more significant is cosmic and beam background, HEC spikes and EM conherent noise. There are 4 different definitions of bad jets to cut apon, "Loose", "Loose+", "Tight", and "Tight+", where "Loose" has the least stringent cuts and "Tight+" is the strictist. The definition for the 4 cleaning cuts is shown in Figure X (Definitions of the jet cleaning varibles are discussed in Chapter Detector). Cutting on the tight+ definition removes a higher proportion of bad jets than the loose definition, but the efficentcy for real jets is also lower.

The effect of the cut definitions loose+ and tight+ is investigated by looking at the difference in the gap fractions (for various slices) and the inclusive distribution for the two cuts. Figure \ref{JetCleanIncl_dy} shows two slices in $\bar{p_T}$ of the inclusive distribution in $\Delta y$ with both the Loose+ and Tight+ cuts applied. There is ~2 percent reduction in statistics using the Tight+ cuts, but the shape of the distribution seems to be unchanged.  
The gap fraction is shown in $\bar{p_T}$ in figure \ref{JetCleanGF_dy} and in $\Delta y$ in figure \ref{JetCleanGF_pt} with the two different jet cleaning definitions. The difference in the gap fraction between the two cleaning definitions is small ($<1\%$). Due to the fact that the difference in observavble is small, but more statistics are gained, the loose+ bad jet definition is used for the analysis.
