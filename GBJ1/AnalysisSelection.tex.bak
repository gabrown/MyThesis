\section{Analysis Selection}
The analysis uses 2 different boundary jet definitions, "Leading $p_T$ Selection" and "forward/backward selection", to define the dijet system. Where leading $p_T$ selection is the 2 highest $p_T$ jets in the event, and forward/backward selection is the most forward and most backward jet in the event. A jet veto can be applied to the boundary system to study the additional ratiation between the boundary jets. The jet veto is a requirement that there is no jets, with $p_T>Q_0$, in the rapidity region bounded by the boundary jets and is used to define a gap event. 

The jets used in this analysis were reconstructed using the anti$-k_T$ algorithm (see section X) with a radius parameter R=0.6. Only jets that have $p_T>20$ GeV and $|\eta|<4.4$ have been used, as these are the regions that have a well defined jet energy scale and jet cleaning cuts. 
Once the boundary jets have been assigned, with the above cuts on $\eta$ and $p_T$ applied, an additional cut is applied to the average transverse momentum, $\bar{p_T}$, of the boundary jets of 50 GeV. This cut is required to ensure that the event is in a high efficiency trigger region. These cuts define the inclusive events for the analysis. A gap event can be defined when we apply a jet veto with a nominal $Q_0=20$ GeV (this is the minimum value of $Q_0$, due to the $p_T$ cut on the jets). 

To study the activity in the rapidity region between the boundary jets, two varibles are looked at. First is the "Gap Fraction", which is the fraction of the inclusive sample that doesn't have an additional jet with $p_T>Q_0$ in the dijets rapidity region. The second is the mean number of jets, with $p_T>Q_0$, in the dijet rapidity region.
