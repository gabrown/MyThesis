I am sincerely and heartily grateful to my supervisors, Fred Loebinger and Andy Pilkington, for their support, patient guidance and enthusiasm, throughout the last four years.
I would also like to thank Mark Owen for his continual help throughout my PhD, and Denis Damazio who supervised and guided me through my service work.

Many thanks to the Manchester HEP group who made a very friendly and intellectually stimulating environment to study.
I would like to thank the many friends I have met in Manchester and while at CERN who made the last four years very enjoyable. 
I would also like to thank Vik and John who shared in the late night work and thesis writing.

I am truly indebted and thankful to my friends and colleagues who I worked with and learnt from through my PhD, in particular James, Caterina, Dag, Pier-Olivier and Pauline.

Special thanks to my parents and my family for their love and support.
