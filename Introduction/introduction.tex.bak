The Large Hadron Collider provided proton-proton collisions at a world record centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.
The ATLAS detector aims to descover new physics coming from these collisions.
New physics at hadron-hadron colliders are influenced by jets, either new physics signals with jet final states, backgrounds to new physics or jets found in the same event as new physics events.
Analysis cuts and event selection on this additional radiation can force the measurement into extreme regions of phase space.
This extreme phase space region can be probed by studying dijet production with additional radiation cuts. 
These studies give important precision QCD measurements which can be compared to various event generators.


In Chapter \ref{chp:Theory} of this thesis the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is reviewed with particular emphasis on Quantum Chromo Dynamics in Chapter \ref{chp:Theory}. 
In Chapter \ref{chp:LHC_ATLAS} the LHC experiment and ATLAS detector are described. 
Monitoring of the calorimeter systems is described in Chapter \ref{chp:HLTCalo}.
In-situ methods used to assess the effectiveness of jet calibration and forward jet properties are presented in Chapter \ref{chp:JetPerf}.
Chapter \ref{chp:GBJ1} presents the analysis which formed the basis of the first ATLAS paper on dijet production with a veto on jets bounded by the dijet system as a function of the dijet rapidity seperation and the average transverse momentum. 
In Chapter \ref{chp:GBJ2} the analysis described in Chapter \ref{chp:GBJ1} is extended to study dijets with a large rapidity seperation, and a measurement of the azimuthal decorrelation is made.
Finally, in Chapter \ref{chp:Conc} the results from the previous Chapters are summarised.
