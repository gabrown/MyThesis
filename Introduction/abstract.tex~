This thesis documents the measurements of jet activity in the rapidity region between a dijet system performed using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}~=~7$ TeV from data collected by the ATLAS detector during 2010 at the LHC.
A number of observables that probe additional quark and gluon radiation in the dijet topology were studied.

The confidence of the jet triggers and jet calibration were also documented including development of the monitoring of the ATLAS calorimeter high level triggers, and in-situ validation of the jet calibration and properties of jet found in the forward calorimeter.

The fraction of events that survive a veto on jets with transverse momentum above a jet veto scale, \qz{}, in the rapidity region between the dijet system is measured for dijets with mean transverse momentum $50<\ptb{}<500$ and rapidity separation of up to six.
The mean number of jets that have a transverse momentum above the jet veto scale in the rapidity region between the dijet system is also measured. 
These measurements are compared to state of the art theoretical calculations from HEJ and POWHEG, and also compared to PYTHIA, HERWIG++ and ALPGEN.

Additionally, a preliminary analysis into very wide separation dijets was started. 
As well as the previous observables, azimuthal decorrelation variables are measured.
