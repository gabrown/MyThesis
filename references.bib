The description includes a resummation which ensures leading logarithmic accuracy for large invariant mass between jets, and is matched to tree-level accuracy for multiplicities up to 4 jets. The resummation includes all-order hard corrections, which become important for increasing centre-of-mass energy of the hadronic collision.},

@article{ref:HEJ1,
	Abstract = {We discuss the universal behaviour of scattering cross sections in the limit of infinite rapidity separation between all produced particles, and illustrate the behaviour explicitly for the production of n jets, W+n jets, Z+n jets for n=2,3,4, and for H+2,3 jets. We give a set of rules for constructing scattering cross sections, which are exact in the given limit, and order-by-order reproduce well the full fixed order results when applied to LHC phenomenology. The approximation includes both real and virtual corrections, and is sufficiently simple to allow for the regulated all-order perturbative sum to be explicitly constructed. We test the expected accuracy by comparing results order-by-order with full fixed-order perturbation theory for the processes mentioned above.},

@article{ref:Powheg2,
	Abstract = {We present an implementation of the next-to-leading order dijet production process in hadronic collisions in the framework of POWHEG, which is a method to implement NLO calculations within a shower Monte Carlo context. In constructing the simulation, we have made use of the POWHEG BOX toolkit, which makes light of many of the most technical steps. The majority of this article is concerned with the study of the predictions of the Monte Carlo simulation. In so doing, we validate our program for use in experimental analyses, elaborating on some of the more subtle features which arise from the interplay of the NLO and resummed components of the calculation. We conclude our presentation by comparing predictions from the simulation against a number of Tevatron and LHC jet-production results.},

@article{ref:JES,
	Abstract = {The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 inverse pb. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta pt > 20 GeV and pseudorapidities eta<4.5. The JES systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams. The JES uncertainty is less than 2.5% in the central calorimeter region (eta<0.8) for jets with 60 < pt < 800 GeV, and is maximally 14% for pt < 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2<eta<4.5. The uncertainty for additional energy from multiple proton-proton collisions in the same bunch crossing is less than 1.5% per additional collision for jets with pt > 50 GeV after a dedicated correction for this effect. The JES is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pt, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pt jets recoiling against a high-pt jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, providing an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The JES systematic uncertainty determined from a combination of in situ techniques are consistent with the one derived from single hadron response measurements over a wide kinematic range. The nominal corrections and uncertainties are derived for isolated jets in an inclusive sample of high-pt jets.},

@article{ref:Dijet,
	Abstract = {Inclusive jet and dijet cross sections have been measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The cross sections were measured using jets clustered with the anti-kT algorithm with parameters R=0.4 and R=0.6. These measurements are based on the 2010 data sample, consisting of a total integrated luminosity of 37 inverse picobarns. Inclusive jet double-differential cross sections are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum, in bins of jet rapidity. Dijet double-differential cross sections are studied as a function of the dijet invariant mass, in bins of half the rapidity separation of the two leading jets. The measurements are performed in the jet rapidity range |y|<4.4, covering jet transverse momenta from 20 GeV to 1.5 TeV and dijet invariant masses from 70 GeV to 5 TeV. The data are compared to expectations based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, as well as to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo predictions. In addition to a test of the theory in a new kinematic regime, the data also provide sensitivity to parton distribution functions in a region where they are currently not well-constrained.},

We also compare our results to those of HERWIG++, in an attempt to ascertain the accuracy of the angular ordered parton shower. We find that there are large corrections that arise for large enough jet transverse momenta as a consequence of Coulomb gluon exchanges.},

@article{ref:HERWIG,
	Abstract = {In this paper we describe Herwig++ version 2.3, a general-purpose Monte Carlo event generator for the simulation of hard lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions. A number of important hard scattering processes are available, together with an interface via the Les Houches Accord to specialized matrix element generators for additional processes. The simulation of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics includes a range of models and allows new models to be added by encoding the Feynman rules of the model. The parton-shower approach is used to simulate initial- and final-state QCD radiation, including colour coherence effects, with special emphasis on the correct description of radiation from heavy particles. The underlying event is simulated using an eikonal multiple parton-parton scattering model. The formation of hadrons from the quarks and gluons produced in the parton shower is described using the cluster hadronization model. Hadron decays are simulated using matrix elements, where possible including spin correlations and off-shell effects.},

These parton distributions supersede the previously available "MRST" sets and should be used for the first LHC data-taking and for the associated theoretical calculations. New data sets fitted include CCFR/NuTeV dimuon cross sections, which constrain the strange quark and antiquark distributions, and Tevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton charge asymmetry from W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Uncertainties are propagated from the experimental errors on the fitted data points using a new dynamic procedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. We discuss the major changes compared to previous MRST fits, briefly compare to parton distributions obtained by other fitting groups, and give predictions for the W and Z total cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.},

@article{ref:PYTHIA64,
	Abstract = {The Pythia program can be used to generate high-energy-physics `events', i.e. sets of outgoing particles produced in the interactions between two incoming particles. The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a r{\^o}le, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest.

@article{Dobbs:uq,
	Abstract = {Recently the collider physics community has seen significant advances in the formalisms and implementations of event generators. This review is a primer of the methods commonly used for the simulation of high energy physics events at particle colliders. We provide brief descriptions, references, and links to the specific computer codes which implement the methods. The aim is to provide an overview of the available tools, allowing the reader to ascertain which tool is best for a particular application, but also making clear the limitations of each tool.},

@article{Salam:2009fk,
	Abstract = {As the LHC prepares to start taking data, this review is intended to provide a QCD theorist's understanding and views on jet finding at hadron colliders, including recent developments. My hope is that it will serve both as a primer for the newcomer to jets and as a quick reference for those with some experience of the subject. It is devoted to the questions of how one defines jets, how jets relate to partons, and to the emerging subject of how best to use jets at the LHC.},
