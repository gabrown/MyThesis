\subsection {Other Systematics}
Two other sources of systematic uncertainty were assessed  by other members of the analysis team.
The systematic due to the prescale and luminosity weights in the trigger strategy  was assessed using the PYTHIA sample and found to be negligible in all final distributions.

The unfolding method used was the binomial unfolding method.
The uncertainty due to model uncertainty and due to the statistics of the PYTHIA sample was assessed and added in quadrature with the other systematics. 
The main contribution to the model uncertainty was due to the uncertainty in the $\pt{}_3$ distribution, where $\pt{}_3$ is the highest \pt{} jet bounded by the dijet. 
The author provided the scaling which was applied to the MC to vary the $\pt{}_3$ distribution.
Figure \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:pt3} shows this ratio between uncorrected data and MC with the JES uncertainty band shown in red.
For the model uncertainty, the $\pt{}_3$ distributions is allowed to vary maximally withing the JES uncertainty band.
The two blue lines on the plot shows the reweighing factors that were used to assess this model uncertainty.

\subsection{Combined Systematics}
\label{sec:GBJ2:SysComb}

The systematics studied above were combined  with a systematic from the unfolding process, which incorporates a MC statistics uncertainty and a model uncertainty, to produce the overall systematic uncertainty, some of which are shown in Figures \ref{GBJ2:SysComb:GapNjet} -- \ref{GBJ2:SysComb:cos2}.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:SysComb:GapNjet} shows the systematic uncertainty on (a) the gap fraction and (b) the average number of jets as a function of \dy{}
The dominant systematic is due to the JES uncertainty, while the unfolding also makes a significant contribution. 
The effect from JER is small, and the effect due to $\phi$ resolution is zero.


Figure \ref{GBJ2:SysComb:dphi23} shows the systematic uncertainty on the differential cross section for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events.
The dominant systematics are again the JES uncertainty and the unfolding, while the effect from the $\phi$ resolution and the JER are small.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:SysComb:cos2} shows the systematic uncertainty on the average \costwodphi{} for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events as a function of \dy{}.
For the inclusive distribution there is no overall dominant systematic, at low \dy{} $\phi$ resolution is large, with JES uncertainty, and unfolding also contributing.
While at large \dy{}, the uncertainty is dominated by the JES and unfolding.
For the gap distribution, again at low \dy{} the $\phi$ resolution is the dominant systematic and at larger \dy{} all the uncertainties have an effect. 

On the final plots, the combined systematic uncertainty is shown as a yellow band around the data point.
