\section{Assessment of Uncorrected Data vs MC}
\label{sec:GBJ2:Uncorr}
This section presents the data compared to the reconstructed PYTHIA sample.

Figures \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:Incl_Gap} -- \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:Q0} show the uncorrected data compared to PYTHIA.
The PYTHIA error bands are the quadrature sum of the statistical error and the JES uncertainty bands. 

Figure \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:Incl_Gap} shows (a) the gap fraction and (b) the mean number of jets in the region bounded by the dijet system as a function of \dy{}.
The gap fraction from data reduces as a function of \dy{}, but for $\dy{}>5.5$ it starts to level off.
The PYTHIA gap fraction curve is consistantly below the data until a $\dy{}=6.5$.
PYTHIA then rises for the larges \dy{} bins, and has a higher gap fraction for $\dy{}>7$. 
The mean multiplicity of jets in the rapidity region increases as a function of \dy{}, to a peak of $\sim1.2$ at $\dy{}=7$, and then plateaus.
Both the plateau and the flattening out of the mean number of jets in the rapidity region and the gap fraction respectively, could be due to PDF effects, such as the ones seen in the previous analysis for dijets with large \dy{} and \ptb{}. 


Figures \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:dphi23}, \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:dphi45}, and \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:dphi78} show \dphiDist{} for $2<\dy{}<3$, $4<\dy{}<5$, and $7<\dy{}<8$,  respectively, for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events.
PYTHIA does not describe the data particularly well, especially at high \dphi{} for  $2<\dy{}<3$ and $4<\dy{}<5$ slices where the PYTHIA is about $20\%$ below the data.
In the  $7<\dy{}<8$ slice, the PYTHIA is still consistantly below the data, but they agree within the JES uncertainty band.
It is not surprising that the cross-section from PYTHIA does not agree with the measured cross-section, as there are large uncertainties on the leading order + leading logarithm cross-section from PYTHIA.

Figures \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:cos} and \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:cos2} show the \mean{\cosdphi{}} and \mean{\costwodphi{}} as a function of the dijet separation, \dy{}, for (a) inclusive and (b) gap events.
A \mean{\cosdphi{}} value of one corresponds to perfectly back-to-back jets in azimuth.
The \mean{\cosdphi{}} distribution for the inclusive events shows a value of $ \mean{\cosdphi{}}\sim0.95$ for $\dy{}<2$.
As the $\dy{}$ increases the jets become less back-to-back and the \mean{\cosdphi{}} falls and then levels off at a value of $ \mean{\cosdphi{}}\sim0.86$ for $\dy{}=6$.
As the $\dy{}$ increase the available phase-space to emit into is larger due to the jets being at very high energies.
For the gap events, the \mean{\cosdphi{}} at low \dy{} starts at a similar level to the inclusive events, but then slowly rises to a maximum of $\sim 0.97$.
When the \dy{} is low, emissions can fall outside the rapidity region, but as the \dy{} increases this region becomes smaller, and the jet veto is stopping hard emission into the rapidity region, thus the dijets are more back-to-back.
The PYTHIA has a slightly different shape than the data.
At both low and high \dy{}, the \mean{\cosdphi{}} for PYTHIA is higher than the data for both gap and inclusive events. 
In the range $2<\dy{}<5.5$, PYTHIA describes the data well.
The shape of the \mean{\costwodphi{}} distribution has a similar explaination to the \mean{\cosdphi{}} distribution, and shows similar features.
For the inclusive evenst, the value of \mean{\costwodphi{}} at $\dy{}=0$ is 0.8.
This then falls and levels off to $\mean{\costwodphi{}}=0.6$ at $\dy{}=6.5$.
For the gap events, the \mean{\costwodphi{}}  rises from 0.82 at low \dy{} to a plateau of 0.86 at high \dy{}.
For both inclusive and gap events, PYTHIA's description of \mean{\costwodphi{}} is too low at low \dy{} and too high at high \dy{}.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:Uncorr:Q0} show the gap fraction as a function of \qz{}, for the \dy{} ranges $2<\dy{}<3$, $4<\dy{}<5$, and $7<\dy{}<8$.
As \qz{} is increased, fewer events are defined as gap events, until at high \qz{} the gap fraction is at 1.
In the $2<\dy{}<3$, the PYTHIA gap fraction is lower than the data for $\qz{}<50$ GeV, though it is within the JES uncertianty.
In the $4<\dy{}<5$, the PYTHIA gap fraction describes the data well for the full \qz{} range.
For dijets with $7<\dy{}<8$, the PYTHIA gap fraction is higher than the data until both gap fractions are at 1.
