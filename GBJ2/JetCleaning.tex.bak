\subsection{Jet Cleaning}
\label{sec:GBJ2:Cleaning}

The analysis removes events with jets that have $\pt{}>20$ GeV  that fail the loose jet cleaning cut.
This event-level jet cleaning cut can be compared to a jet-level cleaning cut, which removes jets that fail the loose jet cleaning cuts, to asses the impact of rejecting events due to bad jets that do not impact the measurement.

Loose jet cleaning does not remove all of the bad jets, and to assess the effect from the extra bad jets, the distributions are compared to the more stringent ``medium'' jet cleaning, which  removes a higher proportion of bad jets. 
The concern with using the medium jet cleaning cut is that it has inefficiencies for good jets are low \pt{}
These inefficiencies have been estimated in \cite{ref:JES}.
Comparing the loose and medium jet cleaning gives the effect of the bad jets and also the effect from the inefficiency for good jets from the medium jet cleaning.
To estimate the effect just due to the bad jets the inefficiencies are applied to the jets that pass the loose jet cleaning.  
Three different cleaning cuts are applied to the jets:
\begin{description}
   \item[Loose jet cleaning] $ N_{good} + N_{bad}$
   \item[Medium jet cleaning] $\epsilon N_{good} $
   \item[Inefficient loose jet cleaning] $ \epsilon (N_{good}+N_{bad}) $
\end{description}
where $\epsilon$ is the medium inefficiency for good jets, $N_{good}$ is the number of good jets and $N_{bad}$ is the bad jets that the medium jet cleaning removes.
The difference between the ratios of the medium jet cleaning to the loose jet cleaning and the inefficient loose jet cleaning to the loose jet cleaning gives an estimate on the effect of the bad jets. 



Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:gap} shows the effect of event verses jet cleaning criteria for loose cleaning on (a) the gap fraction and (b) the average number of ets in the rapidity region bounded by the dijet as a function of \dy{}.
The effect on the gap fraction is negligible throughout \dy{}, with fluctuations of less than half a percent across the \dy{} range but with no net effect.
The effect on the average number of jets is small throughout \dy{} with fluctuations below half a percent.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:cos} and \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:cos2} shows the effect of event verses jet cleaning criteria for loose cleaning on the average \cosdphi{} and the average \costwodphi{} respectively as a function of \dy{} for both (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events.
The effect on the average  \cosdphi{} and \costwodphi{} is negligible for both inclusive and gap events.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:dphi23} shows the effect of event verses jet cleaning criteria for loose cleaning on the \dphi{} distribution for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events for \dy{} range. 
The effect is of the order of half a percent which is negligible, especially compared to statistical and other systematic uncertainties.
There are similar results for the other \dy{} slices.

The cross section distributions show the largest effect, as the event-level cleaning cut will remove more event, but the difference is less than half a percent, and the systematic uncertainty due to this is negligible.
The other distributions shown in this analysis show negligible differences by changing to a event-level cleaning cut. 



Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:gap_ML} shows the ratio of the gap fraction as a function of (a) \dy{} and (b) \qz{} for \dy{} 2--3,  for the medium jet cleaning to loose jet cleaning and inefficient loose jet cleaning to loose jet cleaning with the event-level criteria.
Changing to stringent cleaning cut for the data, the gap fraction change with a maximum difference of $\approx 2\%$ at high \dy{} and $\approx 1\%$ at low \qz{}.
This increase in the gap fraction is a result of gap events having less jets than inclusive events, meaning they are less likely to fail the jet cleaning cut. 
The inefficent loose cleaning matches the medium data well, which would indicate that the effect from bad jets on the gap fraction is small and the main effect is from the good jet inefficency. 
Similar results are seen for the gap fraction against \qz{} in the other slices in \dy{}.  

%Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:gap_ML} shows the ratio of the gap fraction as a function of (a) \dy{} and (b) \qz{} for \dy{} 2--3,  with a medium jet cleaning cut to loose jet cleaning cuts at event-level.
%When this is compared to the data with a loose jet cleaning cut and the medium jet inefficiency applied, and also to the MC with the medium jet inefficiency applied, there is very little difference in shape.
%This would indicate that the shape difference does not come from bad jets, but from the medium good jet inefficiency. 
%Similar results were observed for the other \dy{} slices.

The ratio of the medium jet cleaning to the loose jet cleaning and the inefficient loose jet cleaning to the loose jet cleaning for event-level criteria is shown in Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:cos_ML} and \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:cos2_ML} for \mean{\cosdphi{}} and \mean{\costwodphi{}} respectively as a function of \dy{} for (a) inclusive events and (b) events that pass the jet veto. 
Both distributions show that the effect of the bad jets and inefficiency is small.
At larger \dy{} there are some statistical fluctuation.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:JetCleaning:dphi23_ML} shows the ratio of the \dphi{} distribution function for \dy{} of  2--3  for the medium jet cleaning to loose jet cleaning and inefficient loose jet cleaning to loose jet cleaning with the event-level criteria for (a) inclusive events and (b) events that pass the jet veto.
There is a reduction of $\approx 2\%$ in the gap and inclusive cross section when the medium cleaning cut is applied.
When the inefficent loose cleaning cuts is applied the cross section is reduced by between $2-4\%$, and crutially it falls to below the medium jet cleaning distribution. 
This indicates that the inefficencies of the medium jet cleaning on good jets are overestimated.
The maximum effect from the bad jets is when there is no inefficency in the medium jet cleaning, or the difference to one. 
For the slice in \dy{} of 2--3 the maximum deviation is $3\%$, which would be a very conservative estimate of the effect.
Given that the uncertainty from the JES adds an uncertainty band of about $20\%$, this difference can be disreagrded. 



For this analysis the loose jet cleaning cut is used, due to very little inefficiency for good jets which would cause biases in the final distributions.
