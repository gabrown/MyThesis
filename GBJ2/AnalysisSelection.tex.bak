\section{Topology Selection}
\label{sec:GBJ2:AnalSel}
The jets used in this analysis were reconstructed using the anti$-k_T$ algorithm, described in Section XXX, with a radius parameter R=0.6.
Only jets that have \pt{}$>20$ GeV and $|y|<4.4$ have been used, as these are the regions that have a well defined jet energy scale and jet cleaning cuts.

The dijet system is defined by the two leading jets in the event, with cuts on the transverse momentum of the leading and sub-leading jets of 60 and 50 GeV respectively.



The observables studied can loosely be divided into azimuthal decorrelation observables, and jet veto observables.
Some of the distributions will be split into slices of rapidity separation of the dijet.
The three slices choosen to be the standard \dy{} regions are 2--3, 4--5, and 7--8.
The jet veto observables are the same as defined in the previous chapter, where the gap fraction, \gap{}, is defined by,
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm gap} = \frac{n (\qz{})}{N},
\label{GBJ2:fgap}
\end{equation}
where n(\qz{}) is the number of gap events which pass the jet veto, and $N$ is the inclusive number of events.
The gap fraction is studied as a function of the rapidity separation of the dijet, \dy{}, with a jet veto scale of \qz{}$=20$ GeV, and also as a function of the jet veto scale, \qz{}, for the three standard \dy{} slices.
The second variable studied is \nb{}, which is the mean number of jets found in the rapidity region between the dijets \nb{} that have \pt{}$>$\qz{}. 

The three new observables studied in this analysis are based on the \dphi{} between the dijets. 
One observable is the cross-section as a function of \dphi{} for both gap and inclusive events for the three standard \dy{} slices.
The other two observables are the average \cosdphi{} and average \costwodphi{} as a function of the rapidity separation of the dijets for both gap and inclusive events.
