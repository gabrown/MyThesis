The previous jet veto analysis documented in Chapter \ref{sec:GBJ1} looked at both \dy{} and \ptb{} slices, with a limit on the \dy{} of 6.
This \dy{} limit was due to the central trigger strategy. 
There was a low number of events at larger \dy{} regions and the systematic and statistical uncertainies was large. 
Whilst the HEJ curves agreed well with data at large \dy{}, the POWHEG curves did not.

In this analysis a new trigger strategy is used. 
This allows the jet veto study to be made out to a \dy{} of 8 with an increase of statistics in these larger \dy{} bins. 
Additionally, to increase the statistics, the slicing is \ptb{} is removed.

Another way to study energy emmission from the dijet system is to look at the azimuthal decorralation of the dijet pair.
An azimuthal decorralation analysis, Reference \ref{}, was carried out but only using jets with an $\eta{} < 2.8$.
The new analysis looks at multiple azimuthal decorralation observables and looks at events with and without a central jet veto.
