\section{Systematic Uncertainty}
\label{GBJ2:system}

In this section, the systematic uncertainties from the jet cleaning cuts, jet energy scale uncertainty, jet energy resolution and jet $\phi$ resolution are assessed.
These uncertainties are added in quadrature with other uncertainties calculated by other members of the analysis team.
