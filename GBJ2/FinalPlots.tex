\section{Corrected Data}
\label{sec:GBJ2:FinalPlots}

%First, the corrected data, with the systematic uncertainties discussed, is first compared to some common MC generators in Figures \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:GapFracLO} and \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:NJetLO}.
%The MC generators chosen for the comparison are PYTHIA, HERWIG++ and SHERPA. 
%
%Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:GapFracLO} shows (a) the gap fraction against \dy{} for the corrected data and the MC generators, and (b) shows the ratio of the MCs to the data.
%The gap fraction from data reduces as a function of \dy{}, but for $\dy{}>5.5$ it starts to level off. 
%In general, PYTHIA gives slightly too low a gap fraction at low \dy{} but improves at larger \dy{}. 
%HERWIG overlaps the data  at low \dy{} but from \dy{} of 3 onwards it diverges from the data giving too low a gap fraction. 
%HERWIG has large statistical error bars, and to get a full understanding of the shape higher statistics sample need to be generated.
%SHERPA agrees quite well with the data, but with some deviations at large \dy{}.
%
%Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:NJetLO} shows (a) the average number of jets in the dijet rapidity region against \dy{} for the corrected data and the MC generators, and (b) shows the ratio of the MCs to the data.
%As with the gap fraction, PYTHIA agrees with the data  matching the rise and position of the peak, but underestimates the data at large \dy{}.
%HERWIG agrees with the data at low \dy{}, but diverges at larger \dy{}.
%Due to the low statistics, it is hard to conclude if the HERWIG flattens, or weather it continues to rise.
%SHERPA on the whole agrees well with the data, but around a \dy{} of 4--7 underestimates the number of jets in the rapidity region.
%
%The corrected data is compared the theory predictions from HEJ and POWHEG. 
%The theory predictions are presented as a band to represent the theoretical uncertainty, which was found by varying both the renormalisation and factorisation scale and also the choice of PDF.
%Two POWHEG curves are shown which have the different parton showering, hadronization and underlying event of PYTHIA and HERWIG. 
%The HEJ events have been passed through Ariadne, which is a \pt{} ordered parton shower. 
%
%
%Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:GapFrac} shows (a) the gap fraction against \dy{} for the corrected data and the theoretical predictions, and (b) shows the ratio of the predictions to the data.
%There is significant differences between the three theoretical predictions and the data.
%POWHEG + PYTHIA gives the best agreement with data, and while the gap fraction is slightly lower than the data, it agrees in most bins. 
%The plateau in the data is also observed in the POWHEG + PYTHIA curve.
%Conversely, POWHEG + HERWIG has too low a gap fraction from from about a \dy{} of 2.
%The HEJ prediction also gives too low a gap fraction, but not as far from the data as the POWHEG + HERWIG curve.
%Given that most of the events will have a low \ptb{} without a large imbalance (cuts on $pt{}_1$ and $pt{}_2$ are similar) it is surprising that HEJ does not perform well, especially when compared to the previous measurement.
%This maybe due to the change in kinematics cuts in this analysis, or due to the effect of passing the events through Ariadne.
%Also to be noted, in the previous analysis the gap fraction for data only flattened out in large \ptb{} slices. 
%In this analysis there is not a particularly high \ptb{} cut, and a flattening out is observed.
%A flattening out could be due to PDF effects, for instance if both jets have an energy of  $3.5$ TeV, then no emission can occur.
%A flattening out is also intrinsic with a colour singlet exchange (get paper off Andy).
%This needs to be analysed with a MC that has a model for  colour singlet exchange.
%
%
%Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:nJets} shows (a) the average number of jets in the dijet rapidity region against \dy{} for the corrected data and the theoretical predictions, and (b) shows the ratio of the predictions to the data.
%The mean multiplicity of jets in the rapidity region increases as a function of \dy{}, to a peak of $\sim1.2$ at $\dy{}=7$, and then plateau's.
%POWHEG + PYTHIA agrees well best with the data, overlapping in most \dy{} bins and has a very good agreement at the plateau.
%HEJ agrees with the data well until a \dy{} of 4, but then gives too many jets, and does not replicate the plateau observed in the data. 
%In the previous analysis, HEJ gave two low activity, which would indicate that Ariadne is increasing the amount of activity, but perhaps too much.
%POWHEG + HERWIG only agrees with data at the very lowest \dy{} bins, then has too many jets in the rapidity region for larger \dy{} and but it does have a plateau at large \dy{}.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:Q0} shows (a) the gap fraction as a function of \qz{} for the three standard \dy{} slices for the corrected data and the theoretical predictions, and (b) shows the ratio of the predictions to the data.
All the theoretical predictions agree with data at large \qz{} where the gap fraction is one, this is because the \qz{} will, most of the time, be set above the \pt{} of the leading jets, so there cannot be any other jets in the event with \pt{} greater than \qz{}
HEJ gives too low a gap fraction in the lower \qz{} region, especially for the higher \dy{} ranges, which was also seen in the gap fraction against \dy{} in Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:GapFrac}.
POWHEG + HERWIG has too low a gap fraction at the low \qz{} region for all \dy{} slices, but as with HEJ, it get worse at larger \dy{} ranges.
POWHEG + PYTHIA gives the best description of the data, but still getting too low a gap fraction for $30<\qz{}<60$ for the lowest \dy{} range.


%Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:dphi_Incl} shows (a) the differential cross-section as a function of \dphi{} for the three standard \dy{} slices for the corrected data and the theoretical predictions, and (b) shows the ratio of the predictions to the data.
%For the low \dy{} slice, all the theoretical predictions poorly match the data at low \dphi{}, but improve for larger \dphi{}.
%HEJ does particularly well in the 4--5 \dy{} slice, agreeing with the data for all \dphi{}.
%Both POWHEG + HERWIG and POWHEG + PYTHIA have a larger cross-section for all but the largest two \dphi{} bins for the 4--5 \dy{} slice.
%In the 7--8 \dy{} slice, both POWHEG + HERWIG and POWHEG + PYTHIA agree with the data within the systematic uncertainty band, which is quite large in this slice.
%HEJ how too low a cross-section in the 7--8 \dy{} slice. 

Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:Cos} shows the \mean{\cosdphi{}} as a function of \dy{} for (a) inclusive events and (c) gap events with the ratios of the theoretical predictions to the data in (b) and (d) respectively. 
A \mean{\cosdphi{}} value of one corresponds to perfectly back-to-back in azimuth jets.
The \mean{\cosdphi{}} distribution for the inclusive events shows a value of $ \mean{\cosdphi{}}\sim0.95$ for $\dy{}<3$.
As the $\dy{}$ increase the jets become less back-to-back and the \mean{\cosdphi{}} falls.
As the $\dy{}$ increase the available phase space to emit into is larger due to the jet being at very high energies.
For the gap events, the mean{\cosdphi{}} at low \dy{} starts at a similar level to the inclusive events, but then slowly rises.
When the \dy{} is low, emissions can fall outside the rapidity region, but as the \dy{} increases this region becomes smaller, and the jet veto is stopping hard emission into the rapidity region.
For the inclusive events, all three predictions undershoot the data for $3.5<\dy{}<6$.
While HEJ agrees in quite a few bins, the shape is steeper than observed in data.
Both POWHEG + HERWIG and POWHEG + PYTHIA have a similar shape to the data, but the overall scale is a bit low.
For the gap events, all three predictions have a similar shape to the data, but HEJ's overall scale is on the high side of the data, and the POWHEG + PYTHIA and  POWHEG + HERWIG are slightly below the data.
This observable does not discriminate well between the different theoretical predictions. 

Figure \ref{GBJ2:FinalPlots:Cos2} shows the \mean{\costwodphi{}} as a function of \dy{} for (a) inclusive events and (c) gap events with the ratios of the theoretical predictions to the data in (b) and (d) respectively. 
Similar results to the \mean{\cosdphi{}} are seen for \mean{\costwodphi{}}.
For the inclusive events, the HEJ curve has a steeper shape, crossing the data at $\dy{}\sim2.5$. 
The POWHEG + HERWIG and POWHEG + PYTHIA fall below the data throughout \dy{}.
For the gap events, HEJ is above the data, except at large \dy{} where there are large uncertainties.
Both the POWHEG + HERWIG and POWHEG + PYTHIA fall below the data.

For the azimuthal decorrelation observables, POWHEG + PYTHIA again agrees best with the data, matching the shape of the data, even if the overall scale is a bit low.
