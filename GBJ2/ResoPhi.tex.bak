\section{Jet Phi Resolution}
\label{GBJ2:JPhiR}

The effect from the jet $phi$ resolution was assessed by smearing every jet's phi in the event by a gausien, with the width found by comparing the phi of truth and reconstructed jets. 
The effect is assessed in the same way as Chapter \ref{GBJ2:JER}, using multiple smears and taking the average to reduce fluctuations. 
As no cuts are dependent on $\phi$, only distributions that are $\phi$ dependent are effected.

Figures \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:cos} -- \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:dphi78} show the ratio of the final distributions from the smeared jets and from the nominal jets.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:cos} shows the ratio for average \cosdphi{} as a function of the dijet rapidity seperation, \dy{} for both (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events.
For both the gap and inclusive distributions the increased $\phi$ smearing has reduced the average \cosdphi{} by about 1 percent at low \dy{}, but at larger \dy the effect become small.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:cos2} shows the ratio for average \costwodphi{} as a function of the dijet rapidity seperation, \dy{} for both (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events.
Again the effect is largest at low \dy{}, and the maximum undertainty is two percent. 

Figure \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:dphi23} shows the ratio for the \dphi{} distribution for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events with a \dy{} of 2--3.
The effect from the $\phi$ smearing is around three percent for inclusive events and five percent for gap events.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:dphi45} shows the ratio for the \dphi{} distribution for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events with a \dy{} of 4--5.
The effect from the $\phi$ smearing is around two percent for inclusive events and three percent for gap events.

Figure \ref{GBJ2:ResoPhi:dphi78} shows the ratio for the \dphi{} distribution for (a) inclusive events and (b) gap events with a \dy{} of 7--8.
The effect from the $\phi$ smearing is around two percent for both the inclusive and gap events.

In the \dphi{} individual smeared ratios, the highest \dphi{} bin has lost events which have migrated into the ower \dphi{} bins. 
This is expected due to the boudary of \dphi{} at one, and the steaply falling \dphi{} distribution.

The uncertainty bands will be added in quadriture with the other uncertainties to form the final data systematic uncertainty band.
