\section{Data Stability}
\label{sec:GBJ2:DataStab}

It is important to check the stability of the final plots to monitor the effect of the different event cuts that have been applied.

To check that the cuts were correctly applied, two separate implementations of the analysis were performed and the the agreement of the final plots checked.
One of these analyses was carried out using the AOD data format, whilst the other used the D3PD format.
The effect of the jet cleaning and pileup cuts, defined in Section \ref{sec:GBJ2:EvtSel}, are studied. 



\subsection{Comparison between AOD and D3PD}
\label{sec:GBJ2:AODD3PD}
***should I also add a cut flow? ******

Distributions are compared for two seperate implementations of the analyses using the AOD and the D3PD formats. 

Figure \ref{GBJ2:AODD3PD:gap_njet} shows (a) the  gap fraction and (b) the  average number of jets in the rapidity region as a function of \dy{}.
Figure \ref{GBJ2:AODD3PD:dphi} shows the \dphi{} distribution for inclusive events for a dijet separation, \dy{}, of (a) 2-3 and (b) 4-5. 
All four plots show very good agreement between the AOD and D3PD implementations of the analysis.
