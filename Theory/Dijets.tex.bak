\section{Dijet Production}
\label{sec:Theory:Dijet}

The main analysis of this thesis is directed towards dijet production with a veto on additional jet radiation between the dijets.
Dijet production cross section can be calculated using Equation \ref{Theory:XSec} with the $\hat{\sigma}$ being the partonic cross section for $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering.
Measured dijet production cross sections as a function of the dijet kinematics, for instance the dijet mass, and can be compared to LO and NLO cross section calculations.
The dijet cross section is compared to NLO cross section calculation in \cite{ref:Dijet}, with an agreement within the experimental uncertainty.
The leading order (LO) cross section calculations have the lowest order of $\alpha_{s}$ needed to get the correct final state, for dijets this is $\alpha_{s}^{2}$.
Some of the LO parton scattering diagrams are shown in Figure \ref{Theory:LODijet}.
Next-to-leading order (NLO) cross section calculations consist of the LO cross sections with $\alpha_{s}^{2}$, plus the next order in the perturbative series expanded in $\alpha_{s}$, ie $\alpha_{s}^{3}$.

To study the additional radiation in the dijet region, the fraction of events that do not contain an additional jet between the dijet is measured.
This is the gap fraction, defined as
\begin{equation}
f_{gap}(Q_{0}) = \frac{\sigma_{0}}{\sigma},
\label{Theory:GapFraction}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the dijet cross section,  $\sigma_{0}$ is the cross section for a dijet system without a parton with \pt{} above the jet veto scale, $\qz{}$, in the rapidity region spanned by the dijet system.
The gap fraction is studied as a function of the dijet kinematics, dijet rapidity separation \dy{}, dijet average transverse momentum \ptb{}, and the jet veto scale, \qz{}.

The dijet cross section can be calculated at fixed order using pQCD.
However, for some regions of the dijet kinematics or veto jet scale, the pQCD calculation of $\sigma_{0}$ requires increaseing number of higher order terms, and so aa resummation is done ***ASK Simone***.
Figure \ref{Theory:KineRange} illustrates the different effects that need to be considered for different regions of the dijet kinematics and jet veto scale.
In particular, putting the dijet kinematics to high \dy{} or to large values of $\frac{Q}{Q_0}$ require sophisticated calculation tools, and resummation to all orders in perturbation theory is necessary \cite{ref:Jeff3,ref:HEJ1}.

A number of other variables are used to probe the effect of higher order QCD.
The azimuthal decorrelation variables probe how back-to-back a pair of jets are.
For leading order dijet production, they are back-to-back, but emmision change this and move them away from back-to-back.
The mean number of jets in the rapidity region spanned by the dijet system is another probe of higher order QCD.

Explain both azimuthal back to backness and mean jets.


For large separation of the dijet azimuthal decorrelation observables such as azimuthal decorrelation, \dphi{}, cross section,  \mean{\cosdphi{}} and  \mean{\costwodphi{}} have been proposed to study BFKL effects \cite{ref:BFKL,ref:BFKL_cos,ref:BFKL_dPhi,ref:Anderson1}.
The mean number of jets in the rapidity region bounded by the dijets is also proposed by theorists to probe BFKL-physics at large \dy{} \cite{ref:Andersen2}.
Additionally, the effects of wide-angle soft-gluon radiation can be studied when the \ptb{} of the dijets becomes large compared to the veto scale \cite{ref:Jeff2,ref:Jeff3,ref:Forshaw_Veto}.
